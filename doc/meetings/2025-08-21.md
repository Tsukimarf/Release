## Agenda

### https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/59477
  * Reminder that the cutoff for landing breaking changes is 15 Sept
  * On the build group there is ongoing work to migrate from gcc to clang
### https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/56690
  * Antoine’s old key couldn’t be used anymore as it was missing an associated id
  * The README instructions now also point to our own keyring, otherwise it’s a best effort to try and keep the public keyrings up to date
  * This means old releases might not be validated using keys from the public keyring
  * Not sure what next steps are, maybe better documentation?
  * Ultimately what we can control is our own keyring, so we should point people to use that
